<h2>Chemistry Collection!</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
The Chemist has to collect his vials while new bombs are added after vial rows are collected. Each vial collected gives you different scores - green: 1, blue: 3, red: 5. 
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
New bombs are added after each row completion. The bomb is faster or slower depending on which row was completed. Top row outputs the fastest bomb and bottom row a slower bomb. Each vial is worth different scores. Once all vials are collected you advance to the next level. I used tiled to create 3 different custom world levels. I also added a restart button, music, new background, new physics.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I used the knowledge I gained in my second game regarding tiled to used tiled to create various worlds for levels. I also had to tweak the tileset asset I found online so it would fit my map. This taught me how to use online tilesets and customize them for use. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Phaser first game: <a href="http://phaser.io/examples/v3/category/games/firstgameo">source code</a></li>
<li>Background: <a href="https://opengameart.org/content/sci-fi-background">concept art</a></li>
<li>Sprite: <a href="https://kenney.nl/assets/toon-characters-1">character art</a></li>
<li>Vials: <a href="https://opengameart.org/content/potion-bottles-2">items art</a></li>
<li>Tileset: <a href="https://kenney.nl/assets/platformer-pack-industrial">map tiles</a></li>
<li>Audio: <a href="https://opengameart.org/content/cyberpunk-moonlight-sonata">music</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
My first game - <a href="https://kelly-fernandez.github.io/cs325-game-prototypes/Fernandez_D1/">Chemistry Collection</a></li>
    Added world levels, music, new art, updated bomb physics, restart button, text of game rules, new collision physics, new vial physics
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Help the chemist collect his vials while avoiding bombs!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Chemist Theme
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
The game uses direct arrow key inputs to move the character. The bombs move in a deterministic pattern as they bounce of platforms and the boundry. This game is in the style of 2d platform collector.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
I wanted to use what I previously have learned so far to see how well I could iterate on my first game which was pretty rough.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want the player to have fun while they avoid bombs and collect vials and try to get a high score.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player starts on the ground of the level and can move up, down, right, left using arrow keys. The player can use the platform to climb onto higher platforms where vials are worth more. Once every vial of any one kind is collected, a new batch of vials is released along with a new bomb with velocity based on which vial row was collected. Each vial is worth varying amount of points. Green on the ground row is worth 1, blue on the middle row is worth 3, and red on the upper row is worth 5 points.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The player will decide which rows they wanna clear first for optimum scores to bombs ratios. The player will also have to get used to the movements of the bombs to avoid them.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
Set with an industrial background the chemist hero must collect his precious vials while evil corporate bombs with the aim of storm-troopers try to get him. How far will he get on his quest to collect all of his vials?
Will the bombs ever develop better AI than cyberpunk 2077?
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
My audience is 2d platform enthusiasts who grew up playing these types of games and for lovers of chemistry and haters of corporate oppression.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Depending on the players skill they can last anywhere from 10 seconds to 1+ minutes
</li>
