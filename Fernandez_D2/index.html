<h2>Dune Escape!</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
Help the hero find the oasis before he dehydrates!
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
I used custom tilesets and tile maps to make various map levels for the game. Added a press button to restart as well as background music. Player loses hydration with cursor input and while idle but at a slower pace.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned how to use the Tiled software to create tilesets and maps with different layers. I also leared how to incorporate a reset button and audio.  
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Tiled Tutorial: <a href="https://medium.com/@michaelwesthadley/modular-game-worlds-in-phaser-3-tilemaps-1-958fc7e6bbd6">source code</a></li>
<li>Music: <a href="https://opengameart.org/content/egyptian-styledune-style">concept art</a></li>
<li>Sprite: <a href="https://kenney.nl/assets/toon-characters-1">character art</a></li>
<li>Water bottle: <a href="https://opengameart.org/content/bottle-of-water">items art</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I used the tile map tutorial to incorpate tilesets and maps.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Help the hero escape the desert and find the oasis!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Oasis Theme
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
The game uses direct arrow key inputs to move the character. The map levels are pre-determined so there isn't an element of randomness in this game. The rate at which you lose hydration is also pre-determined. This game is in the style of 2d platform puzzle.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
I wanted to incorpate background music because my last game felt empty without it. I also wanted a restart button because I didn't like refreshing my page. I wanted to learn how to use Tiled for maps so it will be easier for future games.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want the player to feel challenged by the puzzle and excited as they try to finish the puzzle in time.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player begins at the bottom of the map on level 1 with 100 hydration. The player will start losing hydration at a right of 0.05/per cursor input and at 0.005 for being idle. The player must reach the oasis in the middle of the map before they run out of hydration. Upon completion of the level they move onto the next level. If they die of dehydration they must return to level 1.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The player may wish to solve the puzzle in their head before they start moving and lose dehydration. They do lose some hydration while idle so they have to hurry.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
The explorer have become lost in this seemingly endless desert. He is slowly dehydrating and must reach the oasis before he dies of dehydration.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
My audience is 2d puzzle lovers who love problem-solving with some relaxing background music.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Each level should take 15 seconds to a minute.
</li>
