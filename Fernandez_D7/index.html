<h2>Know Your Flags!</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
Test your knowledge of different flags from across the world!

</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
I added individual buttons for each answer choice. The button now registers a mouse click and depending on which answer is chosen it either send you to the next question if correct or subtracts a life if wrong. I also added a lives feature so now players only get 5 lives to be used throught the game. I changed how the game looked to look more polished adding an introduction and ending page. I also added a restart button. The cursor also changes to a hand cursor when you hover over a selection.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I finally figured out how to use text buttons that register mouse clicks. It also took me a while to figure out how to add the element of lives so the game feels more challenging.

        <li>added individual text buttons </li>
        <li>added restart button</li>
        <li>added hand cursor</li>
        <li>added new graphics</li>
        <li>added lives mechanic</li>
    </ul>

</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Test your knowledge of different flags from across the world!
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
I wanted to create a flag guessing game because I've always wanted to learn how to identify flags from around the world.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want the player to feel challenged by the flags but also learn about flags from around the world.

</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player is presented 11 different flags with 3 choices. The player must click the text of the right choice. They will either advance to the next question on correct answer or lose a life if they answer incorrectly.

</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The player can guess any of the three choices until they get it right or run out of lives. They can also play again with knowledge of what each of the flags are after their first game.

</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
This game is set up like a little quiz show of the different flags from around the world.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Puzzle players
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
2-5 mins
</li>
