<h2>Rhyme Time!</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
Type as many rhyming words as you can before time runs out! 
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
Used a timer with countdown, used string array for rhyming word, used prompt to get player input, used button with click action
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned how to use a countdown timer with this game. I also learned how to make string arrays in javascript. I tried to find an easy way to implement player typing text input and the prompt was the easiest way I could find.  
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Timer: <a href="https://phaser.discourse.group/t/countdown-timer/2471/3">source code</a></li>
<li>Background: <a href="https://www.cliseetiquette.com/speaking-tips-academy-awards/">background</a></li>
<li>Pointer Code: <a href="https://phaser.io/examples/v3/view/input/mouse/click-sprite">phaser code</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I could not find a similar game.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Type as many rhyming words as you can before time is up!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Poet Theme
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
The game is driven by the player typing in as many words as they can into the prompt using their keyboard. There is no randomness in the game. I think the player type attracted to this game would be Artists who enjoy being creative with rhymes.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
I wanted to focus less on technical merrits and more on creating a unique game. A lot of the stuff I used here was new so it took me a while to get it working. Most of my past games were driven by what I knew how to code and this is my first game driven by an idea that I wanted to execute even if I didn't know how to code it at first.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want the player to have fun while they avoid bombs and collect vials and try to get a high score.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player is given a word and they must click the button and type in as many rhyming words as they can before the timer reaches 0.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The player can play the game over and over again as they come up with more rhyming words. The challenge becomes how fast they type to reach a higher score if they know enough words.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
The stage lights and mic are on. The crowd is watching. Get up on stage and perform as many rhyming words as you can before your performance time slot ends.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
My audience is people who enjoy poems and making rhymes. People who like typing games would also be attracted to this game.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
30 second timer.
</li>
